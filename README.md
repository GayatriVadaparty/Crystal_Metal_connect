# Crystalline Metals API

The Crystalline Metals API is a local API that provides access to properties of different crystalline metals. It retrieves the data by scraping relevant information from Wikipedia pages. This API allows users to retrieve up-to-date and accurate details about the atomic properties, physical characteristics, and other properties of various crystalline metals.

## Features

- Web Scraping: The API employs web scraping techniques to extract properties of crystalline metals from specific Wikipedia pages.
- Local API: The extracted data is served through a local API, making it accessible from your local machine.
- Metal Property Retrieval: The API offers endpoints to fetch specific properties of individual metals or retrieve data for all available metals.
- Easy Integration: The API is designed to be easily integrated into different applications or research projects, providing a convenient way to access crystalline metals data.
- Customizable and Extensible: This open-source project allows developers to contribute and enhance the functionality of the API, making it adaptable to specific requirements.

## Usage

To use the Crystalline Metals API, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the project's `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the API server by executing the appropriate command (e.g., `python main.py`).
4. Access the API endpoints locally (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/metals`) to retrieve the metals data.
5. Access the API endpoints locally (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/metals/:metalName`) to retrieve the desired metal data.
